Although I am a software developer – a profession that often requires clarity in the brain – my memory sometimes does not tends to function as I would like it to function. In fact, childhood memories, vacation memories, and also software developing memories often seem to slip away, while at the same time I tend to remember useless facts that are not worth remembering.

To prevent spending time on trying to dig up memories in my software developing journey – “How do I do this and that again?” – I have decided to just write them down. Every time I cannot remember something right away, I will check my own blog first before starting that tiresome digging. A potential positive side-effect might be that you, the reader that is not me, could benefit from this information.
